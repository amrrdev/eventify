# WebSocket and Aggregation Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Aggregation Service Initialization Issue**
**Problem**: The metrics aggregation service was starting the interval timer immediately in the constructor with an empty `currentUserId`, causing it to broadcast to no one.

**Fix**: 
- Removed the static `currentUserId` property
- Modified `processEvent()` to start the metrics interval only when the first event is processed
- Added proper interval ID tracking to prevent multiple intervals

### 2. **WebSocket Processor Typos**
**Problem**: Multiple typos in the WebSocket processor:
- `webSocketGatewat` instead of `webSocketGateway`
- `eventCound` instead of `eventCount`

**Fix**: Corrected all typos and cleaned up unused imports.

### 3. **Circular Dependency Issue**
**Problem**: `MetricsAggregationModule` imported `EventWebSocketModule`, but the websocket module also needed metrics functionality, creating a circular dependency.

**Fix**: Used `forwardRef()` to resolve the circular dependency between the modules.

## WebSocket Event Names

Your frontend should listen to these specific event names:

### 1. **Raw Events Stream**
```typescript
socket.on('events', (events) => {
  // Handle incoming raw events
  // events is an array of EventRequest objects
  console.log('Received events:', events);
});
```

### 2. **Dashboard Metrics Data**
```typescript
socket.on('dashboard_data', (metrics) => {
  // Handle aggregated dashboard metrics
  // metrics follows the MetricsDashboard interface
  console.log('Received dashboard metrics:', metrics);
});
```

## WebSocket Connection Setup

To connect to the WebSocket, your frontend needs to:

1. **Include JWT token in authorization header**:
```typescript
const socket = io('ws://localhost:3000', {
  extraHeaders: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${your_jwt_token}`
  }
});
```

2. **Join user-specific room**: The server automatically joins clients to `user_${userId}` room based on the JWT payload.

## Data Flow

1. **Event Ingestion**: Events come through gRPC stream → `EventsService`
2. **Batching**: Events are batched by `StreamWebSocketBatcher` and `StreamEventBatcher`
3. **Processing**: 
   - WebSocket events go to `WebSocketEventProcessor` → broadcasts raw events
   - Metrics events go to `MetricsAggregationProcessor` → processes aggregation
4. **Broadcasting**: 
   - Raw events: `'events'` event name
   - Aggregated metrics: `'dashboard_data'` event name

## Key Improvements Made

- ✅ Fixed typos in WebSocket processor
- ✅ Resolved circular dependency with forwardRef
- ✅ Fixed metrics aggregation initialization timing
- ✅ Removed problematic static userId property
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and parameters

## Next Steps

1. Test the WebSocket connection with proper JWT authentication
2. Verify that events are being broadcast on the correct event names
3. Check that metrics aggregation starts properly when events are processed
4. Monitor Redis for proper metric storage patterns
